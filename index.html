			Born and raised in <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Gotham_City">Gotham City</a>,
			Bruce Wayne is the heir to the Wayne family fortune, which includes the
			multi-billion dollar company
			<a href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/12/10/largest-fictional-companies-oped-books-fict1507-cx_mn_de_1211company_slide_12.html">Wayne Enterprises</a>.
			At a very young age, Bruce had to witness before his eyes the mugging and murder of his
			parents. As a result of his parents' death, Bruce inherited the Wayne Fortune. As Bruce
			grew up, he learned about the corruption and injustice of Gotham city. This fact became
			very real to him at the parole hearing for his parents' murderer. Realizing the
			corruption of Gotham, Bruce leaves Gotham and stows away on a cargo ship to China. It
			is here where he joins the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Assassins">League of Shadows</a>
			and acquires the skills to become Batman. Bruce returns to Gotham after finishing his
			training and resumes his role as head of Wayne Enterprise. Bruce came back with two
			identities: playboy by day, Batman by night. During the day, he drives fast sports
			cars, parties with Gotham socialites, and has girls in his arms. By night, he's out
			cleaning up the streets of Gotham, making the city a better place.

			The name Batman has a very interesting story behind it. When Bruce Wayne was a child,
			he would often play with his friend Rachel on the grounds of
			<a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Wayne_Manor_(Nolan_Films)">Wayne Manor</a>. One
			day, as the two children were playing in the garden, Bruce falls down a sealed up well.
			Down there, he was attack by a colony of bats. Ever since that unfortunate event, Bruce
			became terrified of bats and even had nightmares. Alfred, who was Bruce's butler as
			well as his father figure after his late father had passed, asked
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd1Qp8VwiBU">"Why bats, Master Wayne?"</a>
			Bruce responded, "Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread."
